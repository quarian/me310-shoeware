# me310-shoeware

This repository contains the code used for Team Berca's Funky Screen shoe prototype. This code is **ABSOLUTELY NOT** an example how to write Android code. In the lingo of ME310 Funky prototypes are prototypes that showcase features cobbled together with duct tape and this piece of software is the code equivalent of that.

## What ME310 and what prototype?

ME310 is a Stanford led product development and Design Thinking course. The prototype that this code is written for is an approximation of a smart shoe concept that was to integrate screens onto your shoes and this way enable your shoes to be a software platform for all sorts of applications and services that would help your life.

## So how to run this code?

You can certainly try this prototype if you wish. Here's what you will need:

* A pair of shoes
* Duct tape
* Three Android phones
  * Two that have Android version 2.3.6 or lower, but higher or equal than 2.2
  * One that is strictly higher version to 2.3.6
* Android Studio or other tools to create the .apk to get the software to your phones
* (Optional but recommended) Someone who knows how Android programming workds, since this contraption is likely to not work out-of-the box

Now that you have all the ingredients, next task is to duct tape the two low Android version phones to the pair of shoes (one phone each, you are free to place the phones any way you like) and install the software to all the phones. Then fire up the application on all of them, enable bluetooth and use the "Settings" menu to connect to the shoe phones from the above 2.3.6 version phone. And voil√†, you have made your own Screen Shoe prototype.
